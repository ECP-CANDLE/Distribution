# Distribution
Distributing CANDLE

This repository contains the definiton file and the dependencies required to
build a singularity container that can run the CANDLE benchmarks and the
supervisor. 

= Building the singularity image:

To build the singularity image, install singularity 2.3 Release:

* http://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases

Once singularity is installed, you can create a singularity CANDLE image by
running:

----
$ sudo singularity create -s 5000 candle.img 
$ sudo singularity bootstrap ./candle.img swift-hypervisor.def 
----

= Binding directories to the image:

To bind directories to the singularity image at runtime, edit this line in the
def file to create the directories within you image:

https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Distribution/blob/master/swift-hypervisor.def#L106

and define the environment variable SINGULARITY_BINDPATH as a comma separated
directories as mentioned here:

http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-mount

and here:
https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/singularity.html

for example
---
$ export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/gpfs,/gs2,/gs3,/gs4,/gs5,/gs6,/spin1,/data,/scratch,/fdb,/lscratch"
---

= Hyperparameter optimization:
The hyperparameter optimization within this image is based on the EMEWS:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~emews/tutorial/

EMEWS is based on  Swift/T parallel scripting language which can be compiled using
`stc`, and run on multiple nodes using `turbine`.  By default, `turbine` will
launches MPI jobs using the batch scheduler (e.g. slurm), In this image,
however, this functionality is changed so that the `mpiexec` call will be done
before the `turbine` call. This is simply done by removing the `mpiexec` call
from turbine as shown here: 

https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Distribution/blob/master/swift-hypervisor.def#L96

Therefore a call to turbine will be:
---
$ mpiexec -n 4 singularity exec candle.img  turbine <program.tic> [args]
---
